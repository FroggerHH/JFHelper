If you have any questions or suggestions please message me in disscord: ```justafrogger```

### Merging the DLLs into your mod

Download the JFUtils.dll and the ServerSync.dll from the release section to the right.
Including the DLLs is best done via ILRepack (https://github.com/ravibpatel/ILRepack.Lib.MSBuild.Task). You can load
this package (ILRepack.Lib.MSBuild.Task) from NuGet.

If you have installed ILRepack via NuGet, simply create a file named `ILRepack.targets` in your project and copy the
following content into the file

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<Project xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/developer/msbuild/2003">
    <Target Name="ILRepacker" AfterTargets="Build">
        <ItemGroup>
            <InputAssemblies Include="$(TargetPath)"/>
            <InputAssemblies Include="$(OutputPath)\JFUtils.dll"/>
        </ItemGroup>
        <ILRepack Parallel="true" DebugInfo="true" Internalize="true" InputAssemblies="@(InputAssemblies)"
                  OutputFile="$(TargetPath)" TargetKind="SameAsPrimaryAssembly" LibraryPath="$(OutputPath)"/>
    </Target>
</Project>
```

Make sure to set the JFUtils.dll in your project to "Copy to output directory" in the properties of the DLLs and to add
a reference to it.
After that, simply add `using JustAFrogger;`.
Then initialize JFUtils by this line of code `JFUtilsLite.Initialize(Info);`.
